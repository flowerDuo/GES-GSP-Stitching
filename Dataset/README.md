# GES-GSP_50-Dataset

## Introduction
This repository contains the dataset of the CVPR 2022 paper, ***Geometric Structure Preserving Warp for Natural Image Stitching***. 

There are 50 diversified and challenging dataset (26 from [1–7] and 24 collected by ourselves). The numbers of images range from 2 to 35.
