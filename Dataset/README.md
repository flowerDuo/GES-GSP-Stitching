## Introduction
There are 50 diversified and challenging dataset (26 from [1–7] and 24 collected by ourselves). The numbers of images range from 2 to 35.

## Usage
	(1). Copy dataset to folder "input-data" in project.
	(2). Make sure the file "xxx-STITCH-GRAPH.txt" in each dataset correspond to the name of this dataset.
	(3). You can change the relation between the images by modifying the file "xxx-STITCH-GRAPH.txt".
