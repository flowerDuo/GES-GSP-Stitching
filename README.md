# Geometric Structure Preserving Warp for Natural Image Stitching



This repository contains our dataset and C++ implementation of the CVPR 2022 paper, ***Geometric Structure Preserving Warp for Natural Image Stitching***. If you use any code or data from our work, please cite our paper.

### Download

1. [Paper](...)
2. [Supplementary](...)

### Usage

1. Download code and comile.
	* You need  **Opencv 4.4.0**,**VLFEAT**,**Eigen**
2. Download dataset to "input-data" folder.
3. Run project.
4. We provide scripts that make it easier to test data. The following are the steps:
5. Edit "RUN_EXE.bat". 
	* Change "file=\RUN_FILE.txt" and "\GES_Stitching.exe" to corresponding path.
5. List dataset names you want to test in "RUN_FILE.txt".
6. Click "RUN_EXE.bat".

You can find results in folder "input-data".

Notice: If you make changes to the code and run it, you can copy .exe from the "x64" to the root directory, and rename it to "GES_Stitching.exe".
