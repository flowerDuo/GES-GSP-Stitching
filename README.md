(c) Several misalignments (red and green closeup) in the ELA’s [9] result. (d) The SPW's [10] result exhibits significant wrong scale at the right end. (e) There are distortions in the red box, e.g., the floor and carpet are curved in the result obtained by GSP [2]. (f) Our result preserves the salient geometric structures in scene.</div>

## Code

### 1. Usage

	(1). Download code and comile.
		You need Opencv 4.4.0, VLFEAT, Eigen.
	(2). Download dataset to "input-data" folder.
	(3). Run project.

Or

	(4). We provide scripts that make it easier to test data. The following are the steps:
	(5). Edit "RUN_EXE.bat". 
		Change "file=\RUN_FILE.txt" and "\GES_Stitching.exe" to corresponding path.
	(6). List dataset names you want to test in "RUN_FILE.txt".
	(7). Click "RUN_EXE.bat".

Notice:
* If you make changes to the code, you can copy .exe from the "x64" to the root directory and rename it to "GES_Stitching.exe" after running project.
* If the .exe output errors, try to run the project to get a new .exe.
	
You can find results in folder "input-data".

  


## Dataset

### 1. Introduction
There are 50 diversified and challenging dataset (26 from [1–7] and 24 collected by ourselves). The numbers of images range from 2 to 35.

### 2. Usage
	(1). Copy dataset to folder "input-data" in project.
	(2). Make sure the file "xxx-STITCH-GRAPH.txt" in each dataset correspond to the name of this dataset.
	(3). You can change the relation between the images by modifying the file "xxx-STITCH-GRAPH.txt".
